# FETIN 2021
Repository that contains my Arduino code for Inatel's 2021 Technology fair.

The project was an Arduino-based automatic pet feeder, called Revopet, which was programmed using a Keypad and an 1602 LCD.

The code is divided with an switch-case structure, so different steps of the programming are on different cases.

Some photos of the Revopet prototype, designed in SolidWorks:
